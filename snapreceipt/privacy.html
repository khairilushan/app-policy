        <h1>SnapReceipt Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Last updated: Saturday, 12 October 2024</strong></p>

        <p>At <strong>SnapReceipt</strong>, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information while using our app. By using SnapReceipt, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

All data, including receipt images, item details, and transaction information, is stored exclusively on your device. We do not access, store, or transmit any of your information to external servers or third parties.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All receipts and related information (such as item names, prices, categories, total transaction amount, and purchase date) that you capture or upload using SnapReceipt are securely stored locally on your device. SnapReceipt does not store your data on any cloud services or external servers.</p>

        <h2>3. How SnapReceipt Uses Your Data</h2>
        <p>SnapReceipt only uses the information stored on your device for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To display your receipts and their details within the app.</li>
            <li>To analyze the items on your receipts and assign categories for easier tracking and organization.</li>
            <li>To enable search functionality based on item names or categories.</li>
            <li>To allow you to manage your stored receipts by deleting any data as needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>SnapReceipt does not share, sell, or otherwise distribute your data to third parties. Your data remains private and under your control.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>

However, it is your responsibility to ensure your device is adequately secured with passwords, biometrics, or other security measures to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
        <p>Since your data is stored locally, <strong>SnapReceipt cannot recover any data if you lose access to your device or if the app is uninstalled</strong>. Please ensure you back up your device regularly to avoid data loss.</p>
